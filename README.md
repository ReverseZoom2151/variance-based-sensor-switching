## Description
The project is an Arduino-based initiative focused on developing and implementing various robotic algorithms and simulations. It explores a novel, cost-effective switching mechanism that dynamically selects between analog and digital sensor arrays based on real-time variance assessments, optimizing sensor performance without additional hardware. The project serves as an educational tool for those interested in robotics, offering practical examples and interactive experimentation.

## Features
### Variance-Based Sensor Switching üåü
This project introduces an innovative variance-based sensor switching mechanism that dynamically selects between analog and digital sensor arrays. This approach leverages the high-resolution data from analog sensors for precise control and the straightforward binary outputs from digital sensors for reliable navigation, enhancing sensor reading accuracy and adaptability to varying track conditions.
### Motor Control üèéÔ∏è
The motor control system is managed by the motors.h file, allowing for precise control of the robot's movements, including:
- Motor Initialization: Setting up motor pins and configurations.
- Speed Control: Functions to set the speed of both motors independently.
- Stopping Motors: A function to stop the motors, ensuring controlled halts.
### Kinematics Calculations üìê
The kinematics.h file includes functions to calculate:
- Position Calculation: Computes the robot's current position based on encoder data.
- Orientation Calculation: Determines the robot's orientation angle, essential for path planning.
### Encoder Data Processing üìä
Encoders provide feedback on the robot's wheel rotations, which is vital for accurate movement control. The encoders.h file processes this data with functions to:
- Initialize Encoders: Sets up encoder pins and configurations.
- Read Encoder Values: Continuously reads the values from the encoders to track the robot's movements.
### Line Sensor Integration üö¶
The project uses both digital and analog line sensors to detect the robot's position relative to a line, which is essential for line-following tasks.
1. Digital Line Sensors (digitallinesensors.h)
- Initialization: Sets up digital line sensor pins.
- Reading Values: Functions to read the values from the digital line sensors.
2. Analog Line Sensors (analoglinesensors.h)
- Initialization: Sets up analog line sensor pins.
- Reading Values: Functions to read the values from the analog line sensors, providing a continuous range of values for more precise detection.
### Data Analysis and Visualization üìà
The RT_Results.ipynb Jupyter Notebook contains data analysis and visualization of the robot's performance across various scenarios. Key analysis includes:
- Theta Over Time Analysis: Examines the robot's orientation changes over time.
- Variance Analysis: Analyzes the stability and performance of the robot through sensor data variance.
- Curve Analysis: Inspects how the robot handles curved paths, identifying potential issues and areas for improvement.
### Event Handling and Interactive Analysis üïπÔ∏è
Interactivity and real-time analysis are crucial for robotics development. The project implements interactive elements using Jupyter Notebook, allowing users to interact with the data and visualize the robot's performance dynamically.

## Implementation Details
### Sensor Calibration Procedures üõ†Ô∏è
Calibration aligns the analog and digital sensor outputs to a standardized range, enhancing the robot‚Äôs sensitivity to the contrast between the black line and its white background. The calibration process involves:
- Initialization üîÑ: The robot rotates over contrasting surfaces to capture a range of sensor readings.
- Normalization üîç: Sensor readings are normalized to account for environmental variances, ensuring accurate detection across different conditions.
### Variance Calculations üìè
Variance calculations gauge the consistency of sensor readings. Lower variance indicates more reliable and stable readings. The project implements algorithms to compute the variance for each sensor, using this data to dynamically switch between sensor arrays.
### Sensor Measurement Selection Logic üß†
The selection logic evaluates the consistency of sensor readings through variance. The robot selects the sensor array with the lower variance, ensuring the most stable data guides its navigation.
### Line-following Control Logic üéØ
The control logic employs weighted sensor measurements to determine the magnitude and direction of corrective actions. This ensures the robot stays true to the course, with weights assigned to sensor inputs based on their relative positions.
## Experimental Methodology
### Track Configurations üõ§Ô∏è
The project evaluates three line-following methods (analog, digital, switching) on both straight and curved track segments. Each method undergoes multiple trials to ensure robust statistical analysis.
### Experimental Procedure üß™
- Setup and Calibration: Ensuring consistent environmental conditions and proper sensor calibration.
- Trial Execution: Running trials for each method, collecting data on theta values and sensor variances.
- Data Storage: Storing recorded values for analysis.
### Results and Discussion üìä
The experimental results demonstrate that the variance-based switching mechanism enhances sensor reading consistency. However, the method introduces instability, resulting in less smooth navigation compared to using analog sensors alone. The findings highlight the trade-off between sensor accuracy and operational smoothness, indicating areas for further refinement.

## Conclusion
The study reveals that while the variance-based switching mechanism improves sensor reading reliability, it requires further development to enhance the robot's overall navigation performance. Future work should focus on refining the switching algorithm and integrating more sophisticated filtering techniques to mitigate the impact of erratic sensor data.
